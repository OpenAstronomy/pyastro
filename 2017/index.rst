The third edition of the Python in Astronomy Conference will be held at the
Lorentz Center from **8 - 12th May 2017**.

This conference aims to bring a wide variety of people who use, develop or teach
people about Python packages in the context of all forms of Astronomy. The
conference will include presentations, tutorials, unconference sessions, and
sprints. As well as building the community around astronomical uses of Python,
the conference aims to improve collaboration and interoperability between
Python, packages, share knowledge on Python packages and techniques. It will
also provide training and educational materials for users and developers of
Python packages.
