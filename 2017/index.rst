Python in Astronomy 2017
========================


8 - 12 May 2017
---------------

Lorentz Center, Leiden
----------------------

The third edition of the Python in Astronomy Conference will be held at the
Lorentz Center from **8 - 12th May 2017**.

This conference aims to bring a wide variety of people who use, develop or teach
people about Python packages in the context of all forms of Astronomy. The
conference will include presentations, tutorials, unconference sessions, and
sprints. As well as building the community around astronomical uses of Python,
the conference aims to improve collaboration and interoperability between
Python, packages, share knowledge on Python packages and techniques. It will
also provide training and educational materials for users and developers of
Python packages.

Attending PyAstro17
###################

Between Sept 12, 2016 and Dec 9, 2016, we will be accepting requests from
interested participants. Participant selection will be made with the goal of
*growing* the Python in Astronomy community and we particularly encourage
requests to attend from junior astronomers and people who are new to
contributing to open source software. Effort will also be made to select
participants who have a demonstrated potential to contribute meaningfully to the
Python in Astronomy infrastructure via providing educational materials,
documentation, and/or coding. Only basic familiarity with Python is expected of
participants. This conference is neither intended to be an introduction to
Python bootcamp nor only for expert-level Python developers.

Until then you can register your interest or nominate someone who you feel
should attend using this `form <https://goo.gl/forms/4Y7CB3mDwB6SqgtH2>`_.
