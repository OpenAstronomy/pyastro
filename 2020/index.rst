The sixth Python in Astronomy Conference will be held at Trinity College
Dublin in Dublin, Ireland on **20 - 24 April 2020**.

This conference series aims to bring together a wide variety of developers,
educators and other contributors to Python packages in the context of all
forms of astronomy. The conference will include unconference sessions,
presentations, sprints and tutorials. As well as expanding the community around
astronomical uses of Python, the conference aims to improve collaboration and
interoperability between Python packages, and to share knowledge on Python
packages and techniques.

All participants at the conference will be expected to follow the
`code of conduct </code-of-conduct>`_.

More details will be made available on this page closer to the week of the
conference.
