Below are some notes on some important aspects of the conference program:

*Unconference sessions*
  Unconference and tutorial slots will include some planned sessions but attendees are encouraged to propose their own sessions during the pitches.
  These will run in parallel with the pre-organised sessions.

*Lightning talks*
  These will provide an opportunity for attendees to make short (3-5 minutes) presentations on any topic.

*Hack day*
  Thursday's schedule is deliberately free of talks and unconferences to allow attendees to spend the whole day hacking on a project of their choice.
  Rough ideas for projects can be presented for discussion on Wednesday afternoon, and there will be time to discuss ideas and choose a project on Thursday morning after more detailed pitches.
  Hacking traditionally continues into the evening after the conference dinner.
  There will also be time to tidy up any unfinished projects for presentation on Friday.
