The fourth Python in Astronomy Conference will be held at the Center for
Computational Astrophysics at the Flatiron Institute in New York from
**30th April - 4th May 2018**.

This conference aims to bring a wide variety of people who use, develop or teach
people about Python packages in the context of all forms of Astronomy. The
conference will include presentations, tutorials, unconference sessions, and
sprints. As well as enhancing the community around astronomical uses of Python,
the conference aims to improve collaboration and interoperability between
Python packages, and share knowledge on Python packages and techniques. It will
also provide training and educational materials for users and developers of
Python astronomy packages.
