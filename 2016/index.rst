About
#####

The second *Python in Astronomy* conference will be held from 21-25 March 2016
at the `University of Washington eScience Institute
<http://escience.washington.edu/>`__ in Seattle, WA, USA.

Similarly to the `2015 meeting </2015>`__ (which was held at the Lorentz
Center), we are aiming to bring together researchers, Python developers, users,
and educators. The conference will include presentations, tutorials,
unconference sessions, and coding sprints. In addition to sharing information
about state-of-the art Python Astronomy packages, the workshop will focus on
improving interoperability between astronomical Python packages, providing
training for new open-source contributors, and developing educational materials
for Python in Astronomy. The meeting is therefore not only aimed at current
developers, but also users and educators who are interested in being involved in
these efforts.
