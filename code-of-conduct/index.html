<p>The Python in Astronomy workshop is a community event intended for
networking and collaboration as well as learning. We value the
participation of every member of the workshop and want all attendees to
have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees
are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout
the workshop and to abide by the following Code of Conduct. Any issues
can be brought to the confidential attention of the workshop organizers
(including via e-mail to
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:python.in.astronomy.soc@gmail.com?Subject=Code%20of%20Conduct%20Violation">python.in.astronomy.soc@gmail.com</a>),
and thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.</p>
<p>The community of participants of Python in Astronomy Workshops is made
up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills,
personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our
community experiences success and continued growth. We expect everyone
in our community to follow these guidelines when interacting with others
both inside and outside of our community. Our goal is to keep ours a
positive, inclusive, successful, and growing community.</p>
<p>As members of the community,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We pledge to treat all people with respect and provide a harassment-
and bullying-free environment, regardless of sex, sexual orientation
and/or gender identity, disability, physical appearance, body size,
race, nationality, ethnicity, and religion. In particular, sexual
language and imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary jokes
are not appropriate.</li>
<li>We pledge to respect the work of others by recognizing
acknowledgment/citation requests of original authors. As authors, we
pledge to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or
acknowledged.</li>
<li>We pledge to welcome those interested in joining the community, and
realize that including people with a variety of opinions and
backgrounds will only serve to enrich our community. In particular,
discussions relating to pros/cons of various technologies,
programming languages, and so on are welcome, but these should be
done with respect, taking proactive measure to ensure that all
participants are heard and feel confident that they can freely
express their opinions.</li>
<li>We pledge to welcome questions and answer them respectfully, paying
particular attention to those new to the community.</li>
<li>We pledge to be conscientious of the perceptions of the wider
community and to respond to criticism respectfully. We will strive to
model behaviors that encourage productive debate and disagreement,
both within our community and where we are criticized. We will treat
those outside our community with the same respect as people within
our community.</li>
<li>We pledge to help the entire community follow the code of conduct,
and to not remain silent when we see violations of the code of
conduct. We will take action when members of our community violate
this code such as notifying a workshop organizer, emailing
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:python.in.astronomy.soc@gmail.com?Subject=Code%20of%20Conduct%20Violation">python.in.astronomy.soc@gmail.com</a>,
or talking privately with the person.</li>
</ul>
<p>This code of conduct applies to all community situations online and
offline, including the conference itself, mailing lists, forums, social
media, social events associates with the conference, and one-to-one
interactions.</p>
<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the
event at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.</p>
<p>This code of conduct has been adapted from the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.astropy.org/about.html#codeofconduct">Astropy Community Code
of Conduct</a>.</p>
