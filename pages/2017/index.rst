Python in Astronomy 2017
========================


8 - 12 May 2017
---------------

Lorentz Center, Leiden
----------------------

The third edition of the Python in Astronomy Conference will be held at the
Lorentz Center on the **8 - 12th May 2017**.

As with the two previous Python in Astronomy conferences we aim to bring a wide
variety of people who use, develop or teach people about Python packages in the
context of all forms of Astronomy. The conference will include presentations,
tutorials unconference sessions and sprints. As well as building the community
around astronomical uses of Python the conference aims to improve collaboration
and interoperability between Python packages, share knowledge on Python packages
and techniques and provide training and educational materials for users and
developers of Python packages.

Attending PyAstro17
###################

Between Sept 12, 2016 and Dec 9, 2016, we will be accepting requests from
interested participants. Participant selection will be made with the goal of
*growing* the Python in Astronomy community and we particularly encourage
requests to attend from junior astronomers and people who are new to
contributing to open source software. Effort will also be made to select
participants who have a demonstrated potential to contribute meaningfully to the
Python in Astronomy infrastructure via providing educational materials,
documentation, and/or coding. Only basic familiarity with Python is expected of
participants. This conference is neither intended to be an introduction to
Python bootcamp nor only for expert-level Python developers.

Until then you can register your interest or nominate someone who
you feel should attend using the following form:
