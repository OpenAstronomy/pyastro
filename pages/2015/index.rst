About
#####

The first *Python in Astronomy* workshop was held from 20-24th April
2015 and aimed to bring together researchers, Python developers, users,
and educators. It included presentations, tutorials, unconference
sessions, and coding sprints.

In addition to sharing information about state-of-the art Python
Astronomy packages, the workshop focused on improving interoperability
between astronomical Python packages, provided training for new
open-source contributors, and we discussed developing a common set of
educational materials for Python in Astronomy. The meeting was therefore
not only aimed at current developers, but also users and educators who
were interested in being involved in these efforts.

Details
#######

During the workshop, we required participants to follow the code of
conduct for the workshop which can be found
`here <code-of-conduct>`__, and we also abode by the `Python
Community Code of
Conduct <https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/>`__. If you have any
questions about the workshop, you can reach the SOC at
python-in-astronomy-soc@googlegroups.com

The workshop was hosted by the Lorentz Center, which is an international
center that coordinates and hosts workshops in the sciences, based on
the philosophy that science thrives on interaction between creative
researchers (you can find the official Lorentz Center workshop page
`here <http://www.lorentzcenter.nl/lc/web/2015/683/info.php3?wsid=683&venue=Oort>`__).
