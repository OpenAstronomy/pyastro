The fourth Python in Astronomy Conference will be held at the Center for
Computational Astrophysics at the Flatiron Institute in New York from
**30th April - 4th May 2018**.

This conference aims to bring a wide variety of people who use, develop or teach
people about Python packages in the context of all forms of Astronomy. The
conference will include presentations, tutorials, unconference sessions, and
sprints. As well as enhancing the community around astronomical uses of Python,
the conference aims to improve collaboration and interoperability between
Python packages, and share knowledge on Python packages and techniques. It will
also provide training and educational materials for users and developers of
Python astronomy packages.

The full list of talk titles and abstracts can be found `here </2018/abstracts>`_.

Below are some notes on some important aspects of the conference program:

*Unconference sessions*
  Unconference and tutorial slots will include some planned sessions but attendees are encouraged to propose their own sessions during the pitches.
  These will run in parallel with the pre-organised sessions.

*Lightning talks*
  These will provide an opportunity for attendees to make short (3-5 minutes) presentations on any topic.

*Hack day*
  Thursday's schedule is deliberately free of talks and unconferences to allow attendees to spend the whole day hacking on a project of their choice.
  Rough ideas for projects can be presented for discussion on Wednesday afternoon, and there will be time to discuss ideas and choose a project on Thursday morning after more detailed pitches.
  Hacking traditionally continues into the evening after the conference dinner.
  There will also be time to tidy up any unfinished projects for presentation on Friday.

Social Media
############

The hashtag for this workshop is `#pyastro18 <https://twitter.com/hashtag/pyastro18>`_,
and the main twitter account is `@pyastro18 <https://twitter.com/pyastro18>`_.
Feel free to use the hashtag before, during, and after the workshop to connect with other participants and the wider
community.
Remember, when interacting with people either in person or online, you
are required to follow the `code of conduct </code-of-conduct>`_.

Livestream and Live Chat
########################

To accommodate remote participation, we will livestream the morning plenary talks and some of the afternoon tutorials.

The link will be posted here on Monday morning (April 30th) once it's set up.
The local timezone of the conference is EDT (UTC-4).
The videos will then be saved and viewable on YouTube afterwards.

We encourage all participants (including remote participants) to join our `Slack channel <https://join.slack.com/t/pyastro/shared_invite/enQtMzQ2NDQ5NTgyOTkyLWIwNGE2NWU1M2MyZjMzYzE5ZDM2OGQ0YjEwYzM1ZjcxMTdmOTM5ODk1OThhZGFmMTA0MmFhY2EzZTA1MTIzYTc>`_ to allow people who couldn't attend to follow along, and to interact in real-time with other participants!
This chat room will also be the most direct way for anyone remotely following along to ask questions during the livestream.

..
  **This bit to be uncommented when the bridge is up and running**
  There will also be a bridged `Matrix community <https://chat.openastronomy.org/#/group/+pyastro:matrix.org>`_ which will mirror the rooms in the Slack channel.

Organising Committee
####################

The organising committee consists of: Matt Craig (chair), Azalee Bostroem, Daniela Huppenkothen, Andrew Leonard, Duncan Macleod, Brigitta Sipocz and Erik Tollerud. The local organizing committee is Kelle Cruz and Stephanie Tonnesen but the logistics are primarily handled by Flatiron Staff: Seran Lee-Johnson and Jocelyn Dorszynski.

To contact the organizers, send an email to python.in.astronomy.soc $AT$ gmail.com.

Lodging information
###################

The Flatiron Institute is located in Manhattan at: 162 5th Ave, New York, NY
10010, USA. There are several hotels nearby in Manhattan, but some will be
expensive; many offer a government rate, though. If you make reservations at
one of them be sure to *check that the rate you are quoted is for all nights
of your stay*.

The SOC has identified three lodging options near a train station with quick service to conference venue.
All three options are within short walking distance of each other; they are offer a range in price and quality.

- Doubletree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Jersey City; approximately $265/night plus tax. `Direct link to hotel site <http://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/new-jersey/doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-and-suites-jersey-city-EWRWTDT/index.html>`_.
- Candlewood Suites Jersey City, with a **reduced price through Apr 15** of $165/night plus tax (single bed), $185/night plus tax (bed + pull-out couch) if you reserve with this link:  `Direct link to Candlewood site <https://www.candlewoodsuites.com/redirect?path=hd&brandCode=CW&localeCode=en&regionCode=1&hotelCode=EWRJC&_PMID=99801505&GPC=PIN&viewfullsite=true>`_.
- The Holland Hotel, approximately $135/night plus tax. The `hotel site is here <https://thehollandhotel.com/contact-us/>`_, but to obtain this rate you need to call the hotel and mention that you are booking with "Python in Astronomy".  The SOC identified this hotel to provide a less expensive lodging option. We encourage you to read reviews of the hotel before booking; the accommodations are relatively basic.

Tax for each of these hotels will add around 14% to the nightly rates.
Other relatively inexpensive accommodation in the New York City area can be found in Chinatown, Hoboken, and Jersey City.
All three of these have easy public transit and Uber into NYC to the conference location.
If you go to Brooklyn or Queens, just make sure that you are close to a subway station.
The subway is easy to use and reliable.
