Code of Conduct
###############

The community of participants of Python in Astronomy Workshops is made
up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills,
personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our
community experiences success and continued growth. We expect everyone
in our community to follow these guidelines when interacting with others
both inside and outside of our community. Our goal is to keep ours a
positive, inclusive, successful, and growing community.

As members of the community,

-  We pledge to treat all people with respect and provide a harassment-
   and bullying-free environment, regardless of sex, sexual orientation
   and/or gender identity, disability, physical appearance, body size,
   race, nationality, ethnicity, and religion. In particular, sexual
   language and imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary jokes
   are not appropriate.
-  We pledge to respect the work of others by recognizing
   acknowledgment/citation requests of original authors. As authors, we
   pledge to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or
   acknowledged.
-  We pledge to welcome those interested in joining the community, and
   realize that including people with a variety of opinions and
   backgrounds will only serve to enrich our community. In particular,
   discussions relating to pros/cons of various technologies,
   programming languages, and so on are welcome, but these should be
   done with respect, taking proactive measure to ensure that all
   participants are heard and feel confident that they can freely
   express their opinions.
-  We pledge to welcome questions and answer them respectfully, paying
   particular attention to those new to the community.
-  We pledge to be conscientious of the perceptions of the wider
   community and to respond to criticism respectfully. We will strive to
   model behaviors that encourage productive debate and disagreement,
   both within our community and where we are criticized. We will treat
   those outside our community with the same respect as people within
   our community.
-  We pledge to help the entire community follow the code of conduct,
   and to not remain silent when we see violations of the code of
   conduct. We will take action when members of our community violate
   this code such as notifying a workshop organizer, emailing
   `python-in-astronomy-soc@gmail.com <mailto:python-in-astronomy-soc@gmail.com?Subject=Code%20of%20Conduct%20Violation>`__,
   or talking privately with the person.

This code of conduct applies to all community situations online and
offline, including the conference itself, mailing lists, forums, social
media, social events associates with the conference, and one-to-one
interactions.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the
event at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.
