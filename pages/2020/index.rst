The sixth Python in Astronomy Conference will be held at Trinity College,
Dublin on **20 - 24 April 2020**.

This conference series aims to bring together a wide variety of developers,
educators and other contributors to Python packages in the context of all
forms of astronomy. The conference will include unconference sessions,
presentations, sprints and tutorials. As well as expanding the community around
astronomical uses of Python, the conference aims to improve collaboration and
interoperability between Python packages, and to share knowledge on Python
packages and techniques.

All participants at the conference will be expected to follow the
`code of conduct </code-of-conduct>`_.

More details will be made available on this page closer to the week of the
conference.

Chat and Social Media
#####################

We will be using both Matrix and Slack for online chat throughout the week,
with a bridge to sync messages from one to the other, so people can use
whichever platform they prefer.
You can `go here to get an invitation for the Slack team <https://join.slack.com/t/pyastro/shared_invite/enQtNjk4MjMxNjE3Mzk1LWZkMGI1N2QxOTBlODYzNjk4OGIzMGI0MGU5YjQ2M2Y3ZTM1MTI4ZGU5MmM1ZGIyYzgxYjFmOThiZDg0ZGI5YjY>`_,
or `here to join the Matrix community <https://riot.im/app/#/group/+pyastro:openastronomy.org>`_.
We will be using this chat throughout the conference for discussions about
talks, unconferences, etc. and to facilitate remote participation, so we
encourage everyone to join the chat and to share the links with anyone else
who is interested in following the conference.

The twitter hashtag for this workshop is `#pyastro20 <https://twitter.com/hashtag/pyastro20>`_,
and the main twitter account will be `@pyastro20 <https://twitter.com/pyastro20>`_.
Feel free to use the hashtag before, during, and after the workshop to connect
with other participants and the wider community.

Remember, when interacting with people either in person or online, you are required
to follow the `code of conduct </code-of-conduct>`_.

Travel
######

TCD is located in Dublin City centre and is easily accessible from
Dublin Airport (DUB), with flight connections to almost all major European
and inter-continental cities. From the airport terminals, Dublin city centre
can be reached either by bus or by taxi.

Taxi
****

Taxis are readily available outside both terminal buildings. A taxi will take
about 20-30 minutes (depending on traffic). The usual fare for a journey to
Dublin city centre is approximately €25.

Bus
***

TCD can be reached by the following bus services, with relevant drop-off
locations indicated by red symbols in the map:

* `Aircoach 700 <https://www.aircoach.ie/>`_ – €7 one way or €12 return. The
  Aircoach leaves from the airport every 15 min to the city centre (get off
  a the Grafton St stop - just beside the TCD front gate).
* `Airlink 757 <https://airlinkexpress.ie/>`_ – €7 one way or €12 return.
  This service runs every 30 minutes to the city centre (Pearse Street
  Station stop).
* Dublin Bus 16 – A cheaper alternative is to take the regular bus from the
  airport that will take about an hour and will cost €3.30. The exact fare
  needs to be paid directly to the bus driver, alternatively tickets are
  available for sale at the small markets in the arrival section of the airport
  (both Terminal 1 and Terminal 2).

The conference venue is also located close to train links at Pearse and
Connolly stations. For public transportation,

the buses, trains, and trams (Luas) in the city centre.

Sponsors
########

The Python in Astronomy conference series aims to be accessible to a broad and
diverse range of participants. As part of that effort, we try to keep
conference fees to a minimum and to provide funding to those applicants who
need it. To be able to do that, we rely on generous support from external
sponsors.

If you would like to support the growth of the Python in Astronomy software
ecosystem, please consider contacting the SOC to discuss sponsoring PyAstro20.
