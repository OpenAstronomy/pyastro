The sixth Python in Astronomy Conference will be held at Trinity College,
Dublin on **20 - 24 April 2020**.

This conference series aims to bring together a wide variety of developers,
educators and other contributors to Python packages in the context of all
forms of astronomy. The conference will include unconference sessions,
presentations, sprints and tutorials. As well as expanding the community around
astronomical uses of Python, the conference aims to improve collaboration and
interoperability between Python packages, and to share knowledge on Python
packages and techniques.

All participants at the conference will be expected to follow the
`code of conduct </code-of-conduct>`_.

More details will be made available on this page closer to the week of the
conference.

Chat and Social Media
#####################

We will be using both Matrix and Slack for online chat throughout the week,
with a bridge to sync messages from one to the other, so people can use
whichever platform they prefer.
You can `go here to get an invitation for the Slack team <https://join.slack.com/t/pyastro/shared_invite/enQtNjk4MjMxNjE3Mzk1LWZkMGI1N2QxOTBlODYzNjk4OGIzMGI0MGU5YjQ2M2Y3ZTM1MTI4ZGU5MmM1ZGIyYzgxYjFmOThiZDg0ZGI5YjY>`_,
or `here to join the Matrix community <https://riot.im/app/#/group/+pyastro:openastronomy.org>`_.
We will be using this chat throughout the conference for discussions about
talks, unconferences, etc. and to facilitate remote participation, so we
encourage everyone to join the chat and to share the links with anyone else
who is interested in following the conference.

The twitter hashtag for this workshop is `#pyastro20 <https://twitter.com/hashtag/pyastro20>`_,
and the main twitter account will be `@pyastro20 <https://twitter.com/pyastro20>`_.
Feel free to use the hashtag before, during, and after the workshop to connect
with other participants and the wider community.

Remember, when interacting with people either in person or online, you are required
to follow the `code of conduct </code-of-conduct>`_.

Sponsors
########

The Python in Astronomy conference series aims to be accessible to a broad and
diverse range of participants. As part of that effort, we try to keep
conference fees to a minimum and to provide funding to those applicants who
need it. To be able to do that, we rely on generous support from external
sponsors.

If you would like to support the growth of the Python in Astronomy software
ecosystem, please consider contacting the SOC to discuss sponsoring PyAstro20.
