.. title: Python in Astronomy 2020

**Due to concerns surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Python in Astronomy Conference is cancelled.**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have been forced to cancel the meeting for the following reasons:

- `The Irish National Public Health Emergency Team cancelled mass gatherings involving more than 100 people if located indoors. <https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/96eb4c-statement-from-the-national-public-health-emergency-team/>`_ While the number of participants at PyAstro conferences generally fall under this number, we allowed Trinity College Dublin locals to attend the portions of the conference which aren’t space limited or covered by the conference fee (e.g. talks and hack day). This follows the same practice we extended to STScI locals at PyAstro19. As a result, some portions of PyAstro20 would involve more than 100 people indoors.
- `Trinity College Dublin <https://www.tcd.ie/about/coronavirus/>`_ suspended all in-person classes indefinitely. Courses and exams will be administered virtually. Students have been told to go home and not come back until further notice. Staff have been told to work from home. Trinity strongly recommends cancelling “meetings, trips, outings and other events.”

We understand some of you may be upset by this action. Here is what we are planning to do to mitigate the problem:

- We will refund 100% of registration fees for everyone.
- Ballsbridge Hotel will issue a 100% refund for all of its guests.
- We will organize a 24-hour global hack day for everyone, including remote and local attendees, to participate in together. Details regarding the hack day will be available in the coming weeks.

We welcome you to reach out to the SOC if you have any questions or concerns. This is a difficult time for all of us and we greatly appreciate your patience and understanding.

The sixth Python in Astronomy Conference will be held at Trinity College
Dublin in Dublin, Ireland on **20 - 24 April 2020**.

This conference series aims to bring together a wide variety of developers,
educators and other contributors to Python packages in the context of all
forms of astronomy. The conference will include unconference sessions,
presentations, sprints and tutorials. As well as expanding the community around
astronomical uses of Python, the conference aims to improve collaboration and
interoperability between Python packages, and to share knowledge on Python
packages and techniques.

All participants at the conference will be expected to follow the
`code of conduct </code-of-conduct>`_.

More details will be made available on this page closer to the week of the
conference.

Virtual Hack Day(s)
###################

In lieu of this year's in-person meeting, which was unfortunately cancelled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we will be hosting a 24-hour virtual hack day from 22-24 April. This event is open to anyone who is interested in participating and not limited to those who were planning to attend the in-person meeting. Note that all participants are expected to follow the `code of conduct </code-of-conduct>`_ while participating in any hack day activities.

The hack day will consist of a few talks from some of our invited speakers from the in-person meeting as well as two wrap-up sessions, to accommodate multiple time zones, in which participants can present the results of their hack. Depending on the total number of participants, the SOC may select only a few participants to present their hack day projects. The schedule `can be found here </2020/schedule>`_. More details will be posted in the `Matrix <https://riot.im/app/#/group/+pyastro:openastronomy.org>`_ and `Slack <https://join.slack.com/t/pyastro/shared_invite/enQtOTU1NTA0MTIzMDMxLTUyOWJiYjQ0NmU0N2MxZDllMTFiMDRiNjViODgzMmE2ZWYzNmE5YjliNWUwM2NjYjI5Zjc0ZWUyZDMxYTQ2NTk>`_ rooms in the upcoming days.

conference fees to a minimum and to provide funding to those applicants who
need it. To be able to do that, we rely on generous support from external
sponsors.
